# fsevents

Native access to MacOS FSEvents in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

The FSEvents API in MacOS allows applications to register for notifications of
changes to a given directory tree. It is a very fast and lightweight alternative
to kqueue.

This is a low-level library. For a cross-platform file watching module that
uses fsevents, check out [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).

## Usage

```sh
npm install fsevents
```

Supports only **Node.js v8.16 and higher**.

```js
const fsevents = require('fsevents'
